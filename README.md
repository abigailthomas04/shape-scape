SUB SURGE

Final project for CSC 1980 and CSC 2280

To play, you will need:
- to install Pygame
- Python 2 or later

 DIRECTIONS:

A terrible storm shipwrecks the ship you were on. You were able to escape to the emergency submarine. You are the sole survivor of this shipwreck. Now the submarine is running low on oxygen and you are running out of time. Hop to the surface while avoid the shipwreck debris to survive !!

- Click the space bar to start game
- Continue clicking the space bar to hop
- Don't just hold down the space bar....cuz that's lame
- ^^ Don't be lame
- Avoid the moving shipwreck obstacles to hop to the surface of the ocean !!
- Click the space bar to restart

To code the hopping effect and create gravity, I watched a flappy bird tutorial by @russs123 !!
